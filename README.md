## 📄 Step 3: Customize Your README

Now let’s make the README file look like a homepage.

### Example README.md content:
```markdown
# 🌟 Welcome to My Website!

Hi, I'm [Your Name], and this is my personal website hosted using GitHub Pages.

## 🔧 Projects
- [Project One](https://github.com/yourusername/project-one)
- [Project Two](https://github.com/yourusername/project-two)

## 📫 Contact
- Email: yourname@example.com
- Twitter: [@yourhandle](https://twitter.com/yourhandle)

Thanks for stopping by!
```

You can edit this directly on GitHub or use a Markdown editor locally and push updates via Git.
